"""LIVE self-check of the AI repair and AI travel-style features, per city. OPT-IN, NOT part of pytest.

Four checks per city, through the SAME code path the API uses (app/llm/repair.py, app/llm/profile.py):
  repair_fit      "I can only do one thing a day but I want all of them: what can I change?" -> an allowlisted, solver-verified proposal that does NOT give up a must-visit
  repair_keep     "Keep my hotel but remove optional sights before touching my must-visits" with the hotel kept -> no hotel switch, no must-visit given up, nothing applied
  style_slow      "I prefer a slow trip with lots of breaks" -> inferred settings only, every one needing confirmation, no invented number the user did not write
  style_budget    "I have a limited budget but <place> is essential" -> a question instead of an invented amount, the place proposed as a must-visit
Runs only with RUN_LIVE_LLM_EVAL=1 and LLM_API_KEY + LLM_MODEL. Hard cap: config.REPAIR_SELFCHECK_MAX_CALLS. Never prints the key or any prompt. One run, a handful of checks: a smoke test, not a benchmark.
Run from backend/:   RUN_LIVE_LLM_EVAL=1 .venv/bin/python scripts/ai_repair_selfcheck.py        Writes ../docs/ai-repair-selfcheck.md (REPAIR_SELFCHECK_OUT_DIR overrides, used by tests with a MOCK client)."""
